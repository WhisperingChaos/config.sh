## Config.sh

Recursively walks a local file system branch, rooted at a provided directory, searching for a file named ```vendor.config```.  Once found, it uses entries defined within this file to download and save a repository's working files locally.

The recursive walk first processes the ```vendor.config```, if it exists, in the root (current) directory before deeply diving into one of its subdirectories to locate others before it broadly traverses other subdirectories in this root (current) directory.  The visiting is ordered by the collating sqeuence of the directory names.  These ordering properties can be applied to, for example, to enable a 'bootable' ```vendor.config``` - one that downloads and installs other ```vendor.config```s to other branches within the specified root, as these will be later visited.

[config.sh](./component) download behavior relies on Github's tarball API.  Therefore, only working files of a specified version are downloaded - not the .git repository (versioning data).  Additionally, this tarball is piped into [tar](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/man1/tar.1.html) and through use of tar selection options, like ```--anchored```, ```--strip-components```, and ```--wildcards```, specific artifacts can be extracted and locally saved.  Please review the [vendor.config Format](vendor.config-format) section below 

Although the features of this script can be broadly applied, it was written as a tool to enable constructing scripts that adhere to principles outlined by [SOLID_Bash](https://github.com/WhisperingChaos/SOLID_Bash).

### Install

Use ```wget``` below to copy the desired version of ```config.sh``` to the currnet working directory.  Replace ```<version>``` with the desired repository branch, tag, or commit hash label:

```
>wget --dns-timeout=5 --connect-timeout=10 --read-timeout=60 -O - "https://github.com/WhisperingChaos/config.sh/tarball/<version>" | tar -xz -C ./  --strip-component=2 --wildcards --no-wildcards-match-slash --anchor '*/component'
```

The tarball generated by the github url includes only the working files of the specified version - the .git repository isn't transferred over the network.  The pipe ```tar``` command then extracts only the components necessary to execute the script: ```config.sh``` from the working files.

### Sample Contents

```
#<vendor.config:1.0>
[whisperingchaos.bash.component]
'sourcer'	'https://github.com/WhisperingChaos/sourcer.sh'	'master'
```

### vendor.config Format

#### Purpose

Defines components that are used to create the current component. Given
#		this definition, the script: config.sh will download from github and
#		install the component to a local directory.
#
#		A dependent component may also represent an aggregrated component too.
#		In this case, a vendor.config file in its "conceptual" root directory 
#		is recursively processed to configure this dependent (sub) component.
#
#	Usage:
#		There are two "types" of vendor.config files:
#		> Static  - A text file whose contents are directly consumed by config.sh.
#		> Dynamic - A shebang file, that's executed as a subprocess by config.sh,
#		whose captured STDOUT conforms to the format defined for the static
#		file. Dynamic execution constructs the contents of vendor.config
#		using the facilities of any programming language enabling 
#		imagination.
#
#
#	File Format/Interface:
#		> File must include a banner that complies with the following regex:
#			^[[:space:]]*#<vendor\.config:([[:alnum:]]+[.-][[:alnum:]]+)+>$ 
#			For statically defined files, this mark must appear as first
#			line in the file.
#			For dynamically defined files, this mark must appear after the
#			shebang line that at least matches the following:
#			'#!/' 
#		> One or more sections follow a banner.  A section consists of a name
#			and a list of zero or more parameters used to control the files
#			extracted from a github repository.  A section maybe repeated in
#			a file and if its parameters are omitted, it inherits the ones
#			defined by the immediate prior definition that shares the same name.
#			A section can be redefined with new parameters.  In this situation,
#			nothing is inherited from a pre-existing declaration.  Finally, declaring
#			a new section without specifying any parameters simply downloads
#			the entire working tree (excluding .git) of the desired repository
#			version. 
#			
#			A section name complies with the following pattern:
#			^\[([[:alpha:]][[:alnum:]]+([[:alnum:]]+\.[[:alnum:]]+|[[:alnum:]])+)\](.*)$
#
#			This name may be followed by a list of options supported by tar.  For example,
#			tar options such as '--strip-component' and '--wildcards' can be specified
#			and are appended to the tar command in exactly the same order as
#			they appear.
#
#			ex: "[whisperingchaos.bash.component]  --strip-component=2 --wildcards --no-wildcards-match-slash --anchor '*/component''"
#
#			Elimate the repository root directory and copy all files from the
#			'component' directory - ignoring any other files in the repository.
#
#		> Component entries follow the a section.  A component is a unit of reuse.
#			Other components may consume other components to create aggregrate ones.
#			Compnents can be executable or simply "included" to construct an 
#			aggregrated one.  Components are typically scripts, executables, source
#			files, configuration files - essentially any object you wish to reused
#			that's expressed as one or more files.
#			
#			Component entries adhere to the following form:
#			> Relative Path - a path relative to the directory containing
#				the vendor.config file.  Better ensures a component's components
#				are encapsulated within the aggregrate (root) component.  If the 
#				path produced by appending the Relative Path to the one that 
#				defines by the location of the vendor.config file doesn't exist,
#				it will be created.  Pre-existing files and directories that overlap
#				the ones being extracted by tar adhere to tar's replacement rules. 
#			> Github Repository Path - a github routing specification used to locate
#				the desired component's repository (repo).
#			> Branch/Tag/Commit Hash - a git label that specifies the desired
#				component's repo version.
#
#			All columns must be assigned a value and be separated from each other
#			by at least a single whitespace.  Use quotes or escape '\' to preserve
#			embedded whitespace.
#
#		Misc:
#			> Single full line comments are supported.  However, uncommented
#				input followed by a comment causes the minimal parser to consider
#				this partial line comment as data.
#			> Blank lines are ignored.
