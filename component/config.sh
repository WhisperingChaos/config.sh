usage: config.sh [OPTION] [ARGUMENT]

Search for and download components defined in a 'vendor.config' file.
Save each downloaded file to its specified directory.  Perform this process
for the provided directory and recursively dive deeply into each of
its subdirectories. 

OPTION:

  --sample     Display sample 'vendor.config' file & exit.
  -h,--help    Display help & exit.
  -v,--version Display version information & exit.

ARGUMENT:

  <FilePath>  A file path that identifies the root directory to begin
              searching for a 'vendor.config'.  If unspecified, the
              process begins in the directory containing the config.sh
              script.  Promotes installing config.sh to <FilePath>.
              Moreover, encourages using symbolic links to a single 
              copy of config.sh in projects containing many
              configurable components as a means of specifying the
              <FilePath> without having to provide it as a parameter.
              For this invocation the <FilePath> would
              be: '$(dirname "$0")'.

	# implementation in packages located in an 'override' directory
	# located in the same directory containing 'base'.  Finally one
